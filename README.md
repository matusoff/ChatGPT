Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the versatility of OpenAI's ChatGPT by integrating it into various platforms, including websites, Telegram, and even incorporating DALL-E for image generation based on text inputs. This README file provides a comprehensive guide to help you set up and integrate these functionalities into your own projects. Below you will find detailed instructions for each component of the project.

Components
1. ChatGPT_Website
This folder contains all the necessary files and code snippets to integrate ChatGPT into your website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By following the steps outlined in this section, you can add a ChatGPT-powered chatbot to your website, allowing visitors to interact with it in real time.
